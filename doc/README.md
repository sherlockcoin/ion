ion Core 1.0.0
==============

Setup
---------------------
ion Core is the original ion client and it builds the backbone of the network.

ion Core is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin, PPCoin and NovaCoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.
